Our UI Kit draws inspiration from the [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) UI. The Documentation UI is constructed with [Astro](https://astro.build/) by [Mickasmt](https://github.com/mickasmt), while we utilize [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons) for our iconography and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as our primary CSS library.
